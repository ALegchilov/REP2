I've never known a girl like you before
Now just like in a song from days of yore
Here you come a-knockin', knockin' on my door
And I've never met a girl like you before
You give me just a taste, so I want more
Now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw
'Cause now you've got me crawlin', crawlin' on the floor
And I've never known a girl like you before
You've made me acknowledge the devil in me
